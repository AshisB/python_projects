Class Overview
The UI_SETUP class serves as the core controller for the Flashcard application, managing user interface rendering, game logic, progress tracking, and user interactions.

Architecture Flow
Phase 1: Initialization & UI Setup
Create_UI(self) - UI Initialization Method

Primary entry point for constructing the user interface

Instantiates and positions all UI components (Canvas, Buttons, Labels)

Establishes the visual foundation for the flashcard experience

CheckCounterRunning(self) - UI State Controller

Manages interactive element states during card transitions

Disables navigation buttons post-UI setup to enforce controlled flow

Ensures users cannot interact during card flip animations

Key Technique: Uses hasattr() for safe timer cancellation

Phase 2: Card Display & Interaction Loop
FlipCard(self, new_word) - Card Animation Controller

Handles the visual transition between card states (front/back)

Called during initial setup to display first card

Manages timing and visual effects for card flips

NextWord(self, flag) - User Response Handler

Triggered by Right/Wrong button clicks

Processes user answer validation

Advances to next word in sequence

Note: Currently commented out, enables button states after flip

Phase 3: Progress Management
SaveProgress(self, new_word) - Data Persistence Layer

Records user performance metrics to persistent storage

Updates correct_flag = 1 for accurate responses

Maintains learning progress across sessions

Phase 4: Session Management & Completion
CheckReset(self) - Session Completion Handler

Monitors completion status of all flashcards

Triggers end-of-session workflow when all words are mastered

Manages application reset or graceful exit based on user preference

Features: Full state reset capability with user confirmation

GetScore(self) - Performance Analytics

Calculates and returns user performance metrics

Provides score display for completed sessions

Tracks correctly guessed words count/percentage

Key Design Patterns
State Management
Controlled Flow: Sequential enabling/disabling of interactive elements

Timer Safety: hasattr() prevents crashes from missing timer attributes

Progress Persistence: JSON-based storage maintains learning continuity

User Experience Design
Predictable Interaction: Enforced button states prevent user errors

Visual Feedback: Smooth card flip animations enhance engagement

Progress Transparency: Clear scoring and completion indicators

Data Architecture
Stateless Operations: Each method maintains clean separation of concerns

Persistent Storage: JSON file maintains learning progress

Dynamic Reset: Full application state can be restored to initial conditions

Technical Implementation Notes
Timer Management
Safe Cancellation: Uses hasattr() to verify timer existence before cancellation

Controlled Flow: Prevents overlapping animations and user input during transitions

Resource Cleanup: Proper timer cancellation prevents memory leaks

Error Prevention
Defensive Programming: Attribute checks before method calls

State Validation: Button state management prevents invalid user actions

Graceful Degradation: Commented code indicates planned enhancements

Data Integrity
Atomic Operations: Save operations complete fully or not at all

Consistent State: Progress flags maintain accurate learning status

Session Continuity: Reset functionality preserves user data while allowing replay

Future Enhancement Areas
Adaptive Learning: Algorithmic difficulty adjustment based on performance

Multi-session Analytics: Longitudinal progress tracking

Custom Deck Support: User-provided flashcard content

Accessibility Features: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation
